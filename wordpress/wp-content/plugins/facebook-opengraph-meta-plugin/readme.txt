== Description ==

This plugin allows you to add facebook like button with the ability to define custom Meta 
properties in your posts and pages for Facebook OpenGraph API.  It means whenever a facebook 
user likes your post/page it will be posted in his facebook profile reflecting the 
corresponding meta properties.  For example if you set an image url  in the meta image property 
then once users like your post/page that image will show up in the facebook feed  overriding any other images.
