* install/activate the plugin (IMPORTANT, we created a folder titled: "MOVE facebookapp folder inside TO THE ROOT OF YOUR DOMAIN". Please move the facebookapp folder that is inside to the ROOT of your domain.  Facebook requires this folder to be in the root of your domain so that it can communicate with the app.)

== FAQ's ==
1. What kind of software is Bugs Go Viral?
 Bugs Go Viral is a plug-in for WordPress, written in PHP, and using MySQL. This plug-in allows you to administer a Facebook application directly from your WordPress admin.

2. Where are Bugs Go Viral promotions hosted?
 Your Bugs Go Viral promotions are hosted on your WordPress website. However, all promotions are actually executed directly on Facebook via iframe. We made the conscious decision to execute promotions within Facebook as opposed to hosting them off-site and requiring your fans to leave Facebook to participate.

3. How much do Bugs Go Viral promotions cost?
 The software can be downloaded for free, and you can test drive and configure promotions at no cost. You only pay when you activate a promotion on Facebook. Each Bugs Go Viral promotion type runs on a daily pricing model, with a different daily price for each promo and with discounts for extended promos. You can get an estimate for your promo here.

4. How is Bugs Go Viral different from other promotional platforms?
 Simple: Bugs Go Viral is 100% white-label and 100% contained within Facebook.

5. Is Bugs Go Viral consistent with Facebook guidelines and policies for promotions?
 Yes. We made sure that our software is consistent with BOTH Facebook guidelines for promotions executed within Facebook AND for promotions executed elsewhere and promoted on Facebook. We also took great care to build in plenty of margin for privacy and respect for users' personal information. Participants in our promotions must always approve any message that is posted to their wall. No message is posted to the participants wall without their knowledge.
