WP-SQLI-LAB
===========

Wordpress SQL Injection Lab, for testing and automating sql injection research on Wordpress

This lab provides a sizeable set of SQL injection exploits for wordpress plugins, and allows SQL injection prevention methods (such as IDSs, firewalls, etc.) be automatically tested. 

The main program in the lab folder installs each plugin into wordpress (if not already installed), and then checks each exploit against the wordpress setup.
